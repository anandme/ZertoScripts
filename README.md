# ZertoScripts
Repository for Zerto Automation Scripts

Please note that some of these scripts have been created by and provided by Zerto through documentation that is readily available on their support portal.

For the BulkVRADeploy.ps1 script, the VRADeploymentESXiHosts.csv is required.  It is a comma-separated file that can either be edited in a text editor.  All fields contained within need to be exact to avoid the script failing when being run.

In the BuilVRADeploy.ps1 script, there is a section at the top, which is the only section that should be edited for your own environment's settings.
