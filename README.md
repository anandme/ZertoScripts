# ZertoScripts
Repository for Zerto Automation Scripts

Please note that some of these scripts have been created by and provided by Zerto through documentation that is readily available on their support portal.

For the BulkVRADeploy.ps1 script, the VRADeploymentESXiHosts.csv is required.  It is a comma-separated file that can either be edited in a text editor, or Excel, with Excel being the easiest to follow along with columns in.  All fields contained within need to be exact to avoid the script failing when being run.

There is no need to edit the BulkVRADeploy.ps1 script.  I've updated it to prompt the user for values, to avoid having to edit code and potentially create errors.
